# Phoenix (WIP)

Believe it or not, in the not so distant past, browsers were designed to put the user first. There's a reason that another word to refer to them is [**user agent**](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent).

Sadly, this time has passed. The majority of the browser market is now controlled by Google, an ad surveillance company. In all fairness to Google, they **do** put their customers first - it's just that their customers are the advertisers they siphon your data too, not users like you and me. And this is the company behind the engine powering nearly every modern web browser. Talk about a conflict of interest...

But it doesn't have to be this way.

Phoenix is a suite of configurations & advanced modifications for Mozilla Firefox, designed to give the power back to the users. 

# Why Mozilla Firefox?

Firefox is one of the last engines standing in the way of Google's Chromium monopoly. The browser is also free, open source, & highly customizable. **There is simply no other browser out there that allows for the level of configuration that Phoenix provides.**

# Why not just fork Firefox and create your own browser like LibreWolf?

1 Major reason: Security updates. I am the only person working on this project, and I am not currently in a position to guarantee consistent browser security updates. Things happen. The majority of browser forks do not take matters like this seriously, but Phoenix is different: We put privacy & security at the forefront of everything we do. I am not willing to put my users at risk, now or ever.

The fact of the matter is that due to Firefox's strong support for customization & advanced configuration, there's next to nothing that a browser fork can offer over just sticking to it as base.
